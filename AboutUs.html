		<h1>About us</h1>
		<p>Heart of Garden, a Durban-based nursery, was established in 2021 by Chanelle BÃ¶siger. After being retrenched
			she decided to take another career path and opened this nursery that specialises in indigenous flowering
			plants.</p>
		<img src="images/Chanelle.jpg" alt=Photo class=".img-fluid rounded-circle" id="chanelleimg">
		<p>The decision to do so was based on the fact that she wanted to create awareness about and positively
			contribute to our world's ecosystem.</p>
		<p>Bee and other insect populations are decreasing fast due to our impact on the environment. One way to
			contribute to creating a better future is by planting indigenous flowering plants.</p>
		<p>Not only do flowering plants create a colourful and cheerful home environment that improves your mood, they
			also:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Attract bees</li>
		<li>Attract other insects, such as butterflies and ladybird beetles</li>
		<li>Attract birds</li>
		<li>Carbon dioxide is absorbed and more oxygen is released into the atmosphere</li>
		<li>Regulate water cycles</li>
	</ul>
